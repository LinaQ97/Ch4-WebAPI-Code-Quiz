# Ch4-WebAPI-Code-Quiz

## Description

In this Challenge we had to create a Quiz that would be functional with buttons, pop ups with indication of chosen answer being correct of incorrect, and score presented at the end. This project has been quite the challenge. There still is work that needs to be done/corrected on this assignment. Creating this quiz allows us to understand how each element is to be used between the HTML, CSS, and JS. This is a presentation of what a real life job requesting specific projects and functions can look like. It is to put my knowledge to the test.
